00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
melissa: It's really a pain to set everything up.

2
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.110
melissa: No other way around. Sorry, guys.

3
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.660
melissa: Make sure it's all in here, great, cool. Um,

4
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:53.910
melissa: So we're going to start going opens up so you can see I have my weather app I have JavaScript going to open it up and I have in here.

5
00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.690
melissa: Because I was playing around with this on my own. I have two API's and to

6
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.920
melissa: API keys, um,

7
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.770
melissa: So those are things I don't want on GitHub. Right. So how do we get there. The first thing first, that in your

8
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:29.010
melissa: I'm going to use the terminal for this guy's you need to make a we're going to make some new files inside of our project. So that's first. The first thing you're going to want is to make a file called confit doc as

9
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.710
melissa: And then the second file, you're going to want to make it something called a dot get ignored.

10
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:46.080
melissa: Yet Ellis pack a great looks like both of those have been added to my. Oh, right. I'm in

11
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.440
melissa: I'm just gonna fix this in here I'm weather app.

12
00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.780
melissa: Both the gig noise finding their config, you're gonna want to move into your JavaScript file because it is also a JavaScript file.

13
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:13.200
melissa: So you should now have your script jazz right in your config jazz cool. Um, what is the next step that we have to do if we want to use a JavaScript file in our project.

14
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.790
austin: Make a pathway. Enter index.

15
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.840
Yeah.

16
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:28.050
melissa: Um, cool. So where this is going to live here, basically, is that, first you're going to, you're going to want to include it.

17
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:39.600
melissa: Before your main JS file because your main JS file is going to use information from this config.

18
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:52.650
melissa: Just like our library does right we put jQuery before script because script uses things from jQuery, we're going to have a config jazz before script because script is going to use things from config. Does that make sense so far.

19
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.110
melissa: Cool. Alright, so let's go back. I'm going to

20
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.510
melissa: Full screen. This

21
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:13.140
melissa: Um, so we're gonna hit Control save. That's all we have to do with our index dot html going to open up script and I'm going to open up config over here, just so we can see them side by side.

22
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:23.790
melissa: Cool. So all we're going to make in this config file is a constant all content set that equal to an object.

23
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.660
melissa: This is the only thing that's going to live in this file.

24
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:41.580
melissa: Now we need some key value pairs in here. So let's say that the first one. Um, so this is you're going to see me use all caps for this, guys. It's kind of just like a naming convention thing. These are

25
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:53.490
melissa: Values that aren't going to change that I'm using from another file, so it's good practice to just give them an all caps name. Um, so I'm going to call this. Let's see.

26
00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.240
melissa: Whether API, he, he

27
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.030
melissa: Will do this way.

28
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.190
And

29
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.950
melissa: Cool. And then I'm going to go back into here scroll

30
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.130
melissa: Excuse you school

31
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.040
melissa: And I'm going to copy my API key. I'm going to take the whole thing out.

32
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.650
melissa: And put in a string in here.

33
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:32.460
melissa: Everyone following me so far with this cool really easy, right. We're just making an object. So I'm going to do the same thing with my other API key.

34
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:56.730
melissa: And I have both of them here. And that's it. Now I'm places holding our APIs at separate from our main script.

35
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:07.500
melissa: Great. So then in here. The next thing we need is we need access to that to the config right so let's just try to

36
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.220
melissa: Create a new variable.

37
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.970
melissa: Whoops, I'm still in caps.

38
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.610
melissa: I'm going to call this variable config. And I'm going to set it equal to

39
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.740
melissa: A. I think I can do set this equal to conflict now.

40
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.720
melissa: Let's just console log that so I'm not crazy.

41
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.720
melissa: Did not like that. Hold on guys, I look back at these notes. I was copying from this morning.

42
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.420
Nathan Childress: I mean, do you want to test it by just renaming the local config to something else.

43
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.930
melissa: I'm actually wondering if I can just

44
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.190
melissa: So not long config.

45
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:27.150
Here we go.

46
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:49.470
melissa: Yeah. OK, cool. So now you see, um, because it's in our HTML, um, that we just have access to this config object, right guys on you have both those are both my API keys. Great. So then, all we're going to do in here is we're going to, let's set this equal to constant my configs

47
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.500
melissa: An equal a tour. Actually, we don't even have to do that. We're not going to bother with the variable.

48
00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:11.730
melissa: So we know we have access to config. So the next thing we're going to do is we're going to go to where we had those keys before. And since I'm already using a string interpolation. This is easy. And we're just going to say config dot whether API key.

49
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.120
melissa: And then I'm going to go in here and

50
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.660
melissa: They got, um, what I call it Google Maps, Google Maps API key.

51
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:28.230
melissa: Great. So let's see if that if I if my WEATHER APP still works.

52
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.950
melissa: Yeah, I still have only known look at the CSS. Don't worry about that.

53
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:47.040
melissa: I still have all my weather information. Awesome. Cool. So now why did I move this out into its own separate um

54
00:07:48.090 --> 00:08:02.730
melissa: File for development. This is a our next step. This is why we created what's called the get ignore. So getting more and you have to name it like this with the.in front docket ignore is a special file that GitHub understands

55
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:20.790
melissa: That you put into your system and say, hey, whenever I commit code. I want you to ignore any file or folder that is inside of this file. Um, so in this case what we wanted to ignore is

56
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:22.650
melissa: Yeah.

57
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:31.680
melissa: weather app you're going to just put the relative pathway to your thing JS.

58
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.910
melissa: And you get to control save

59
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.370
melissa: And now if I go into my terminal and I do it get status.

60
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.380
melissa: cd into whether have to show this better.

61
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:49.050
melissa: Status.

62
00:08:50.160 --> 00:09:01.560
melissa: Look, the only thing that says it's been trapped. Is that get ignore right, you can't see that. Um, I don't see my config file anywhere so I do get add a

63
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.170
melissa: good head start.

64
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:25.380
melissa: Well, so the only files that my repository say that I've created is my get ignored my style my index and my script.

65
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.190
melissa: Does anyone have any questions at this point.

66
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.840
diegoburgos: I don't have question but

67
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:43.020
diegoburgos: Can you base, what you put in the HTML in there.

68
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:49.920
melissa: Oh, I put in the HTML Diego is is that script tag.

69
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:57.810
melissa: That is the same as your script JS, it's just going to be your for your config, and it has to go before the script.

70
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:58.860
melissa: Jazz. That's it.

71
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:16.710
melissa: That's it. That's the whole the whole session, I will post the guide guys that I wrote up to follow for this code along

72
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.290
melissa: So now you can see that

73
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.170
melissa: Um, but yeah. So now if I do get

74
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:26.910
melissa: Commit

75
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.790
melissa: Created awesome weather app.

76
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:40.080
melissa: Don't put things in your messages and messes them up. I'm

77
00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:45.540
melissa: Origin.

78
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.290
melissa: Special password.

79
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.010
melissa: Cool. So let's go look at my GitHub.

80
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.320
melissa: Refresh.

81
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.420
melissa: And we go into WEATHER APP AND WE GO INTO JS and there's no config file.

82
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.790
melissa: And you go into script.

83
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:24.540
melissa: And you can see that the content of the value that we made is still here. But there's nothing for hackers to read nothing for them to scrape that's actually useful.

84
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:35.400
melissa: And that's it. And that's how you hide your API keys for your projects for development. Oh, when we get to deployment. I'll be going over how we add a

85
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:50.430
melissa: Basically, they call them like environmental variables, but I have to look into the best way and easiest way for you guys to do that for a client side project. I haven't done that before. I've always had my environmental variables in my back end.

86
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:57.450
melissa: Which, you know, it's just new so I'm going to learn something. This week guys. Very excited

87
00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:03.120
melissa: Great, so I'll post the guide, but that's it. That's the whole code alone.

88
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:07.140
chas | he/him: Sorry if you touched on this. I

89
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.630
chas | he/him: might have missed it, but we push to getting more to our remote repo.

90
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:22.230
melissa: Yes, yes. So you. Yeah. So if you go back here you will see I have my docket ignore the.is very important has to be docket ignore

91
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:35.250
melissa: And you'll see that it says what to ignore. So like, you know, someone will look into this and see like I see they are hiding this information, but they still can't see what information I'm hiding just that I didn't add it

92
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.790
melissa: Great. I'm going to stop sharing my screen now. I'm a big desktop.

93
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.510
melissa: I can find the button. There it is.

94
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:56.340
melissa: Cool. Yeah. And I'll post this into the Slack channel probably into the debugging thread.

95
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.520
melissa: So everyone feel good. Ready to hide some keys from your

96
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.380
melissa: From the scrapers

97
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.470
melissa: Awesome.

98
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:14.550
melissa: Great. You guys can go back to your breakout rooms to keep working. If you want if anyone has questions, let me know.
